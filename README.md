# Tidbyt: Hello World Apps

These are the barebones apps from the tutorials for [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com).

I followed the **[Hello, World!](https://tidbyt.dev/docs/build/build-for-tidbyt)** tutorial for the first one, and clicked through the links for others.

Nothing really custom in any of the scripts in this repo, other than maybe a text string or two.
